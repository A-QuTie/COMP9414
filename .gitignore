Since you're using uv for your COMP9414 project, your .gitignore needs to handle standard Python artifacts as well as specific files created by the uv tool.

Here is a lean, performance-oriented .gitignore template tailored to your setup:

Recommended .gitignore
Code snippet
# --- Python Specific ---
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# --- Environment and uv ---
# uv creates a .venv folder by default
.venv/
.python-version

# --- IDE and OS ---
.vscode/
.idea/
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# --- Data and Logs ---
*.log
data/
# Ignore large datasets if you download them for AI labs
!data/.gitkeep
